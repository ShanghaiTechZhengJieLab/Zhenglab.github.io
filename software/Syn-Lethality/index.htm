			<p style="font-family:verdana;color:blue";> <br> Synthetic lethality arises when a combination of mutations in two or more genes leads to cell death, whereas a mutation in only one of these genes does not, and by itself is said to be viable. This area has recently attracted attention because of the prospect of a new generation of anti-cancer drugs. While numerous SL interactions have been identified in yeast, only a few have been known in human. There is a pressing need to systematically discover and understand SL interactions specific to human cancer.The primary aim of our Syn-Lethality database is to collect and maintain a high quality set of SL gene pairs, which serves as a comprehensive, fully classified and accurately annotated knowledgebase for SL-related research. The database also provides extensive cross-references and querying interfaces.<br><br>
The NTU Synthetic Lethality Database has been developed by <a href="http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/birc/" target=_blank> NTU BIRC Research Team </a> for the scientific community, for free. You can find information related to various synthetic lethal genes by performing the Query using our software, with different genetic combinations.  If you're having problems in using this software through this website, then don't hesitate to ask for help via the <a href="http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/birc/" target=_blank> Our Research Lab</a>.</p>
